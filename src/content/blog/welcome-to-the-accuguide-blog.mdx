Welcome to Accuguide's official blog! We're so glad you're here!
This blog is where we'll share updates, accessibility tips, stories from real people, and much more!

## What is Accuguide?

Accuguide is a community-driven web app designed to help people with disabilities find, rate, and review places based on their accessibility. Think of it like Yelp—but focused on the details that matter when accessibility is a priority. Whether you're looking for step-free entrances, accessible restrooms, sensory-friendly spaces, and more, Accuguide aims to provide the information you need—before you arrive.

## Why I started Accuguide

The idea for Accuguide came from a personal challenge. Like many of my disabled peers, I’ve often struggled to know whether a restaurant or business will actually be accessible. Sometimes there’s a surprise step at the entrance. Sometimes there’s no space to turn a wheelchair around once you're inside. And sometimes, places marked "accessible" online don’t tell the whole story. I realized there wasn’t a reliable, centralized resource for this kind of information—so I decided to build a community-driven solution.

## How Accuguide works

Accuguide pulls in millions of locations using the **Google Maps API**, and lets users **rate and review them based on specific accessibility features**. It also uses AI to generate helpful summaries about a location’s accessibility. Best of all, it’s **completely open-source**, so anyone can contribute or suggest improvements. Whether you're a developer, designer, or just someone with ideas, we’d love to have you involved!

## What tools does Accuguide run on?

While this blog won’t focus too heavily on the technical side, here’s a quick snapshot of what’s under the hood:

- Built with **Next.js** (full-stack framework)
- Uses **PostgreSQL** as the database
- Designed with **Tailwind CSS** and **Shadcn UI** for a clean, modern look
- Entirely open-source and beginner-friendly on [GitHub](https://github.com/accuguide/accuguide)

## What’s Next?

There’s still a lot to improve, from adding more accessibility indicators to refining our community features, but the journey has officially begun.
Thanks for being here at the start. I truly hope Accuguide makes it easier for people to move through the world with more confidence, comfort, and clarity.
More blog posts coming soon—including contributor spotlights, new feature announcements, and accessibility insights from the community.
